# **Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm**
mod108 task for Model Analysis I course at UL FMF.

## Notes
You can enable mpl Interactive plots on Linux by exporting the following environment variable:
```bash
export MPLBACKEND=qtagg
```
or in `fish` which is what I use as my shell:
```fish
set -x MPLBACKEND qtagg
```
These two lines can be added to either `~/.bashrc` or `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to make the change permanent. I've also included two scripts for running multiple runs of a simulation for both `bash` and `fish`.
